Portfolio site added

This repository now includes a responsive portfolio layout under `src/` built with React + TypeScript.

Quick start:

1. Install deps:

   npm install

2. Run dev server:

Files to update with your details:

- `src/config/content.ts` — replace name, summary, projects, skills, experience, and links
- `src/styles/portfolio.css` — tweak colors/spacing
